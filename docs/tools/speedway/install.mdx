This guide will walk you through the process of installing our libraries, creating a new project, and deploying it to the Sonr platform.

The Speedway CLI allows developers all the comforts of Speedway into a command-line interface. Speedway User-Interface gives developers the ability to visually create schemas, objects and buckets in a web application.

## Prerequisites

Be sure you have met the prerequisites before you install and use Speedway CLI.

### Operating systems

Speedway CLI is supported for the following operating systems:

- GNU/Linux
- macOS

### Go

Speedway CLI is written in the Go programming language. To use Speedway CLI on a local system:

- Install Go (version [1.17](https://go.dev/dl/#go1.17.13) or [1.18](https://go.dev/dl/#go1.18.6))
- Ensure the Go environment variables are [set properly](https://go.dev/doc/gopath_code#GOPATH) on your system

## Installing Speedway CLI

<APIButton href="/docs/tools/speedway/cli" label="CLI Reference" />

To install the latest version of the `speedway` binary use the following command.

```bash
curl http://i.sonrd.sh/sonr-io/speedway! | bash
```

This command invokes curl to download the install script and pipes the output to bash to perform the installation. The `speedway` binary is installed in /usr/local/bin.

### Write permission

Speedway CLI installation requires write permission to the `/usr/local/bin/` directory. If the installation fails because you do not have write permission to `/usr/local/bin/`, run the following command:

```bash
curl http://i.sonrd.sh/sonr-io/speedway | bash
```

Then run this command to move the speedway executable to /usr/local/bin/:

```bash
sudo mv speedway /usr/local/bin/
```

On some machines, a permissions error occurs:

```bash
mv: rename ./speedway to /usr/local/bin/speedway: Permission denied
============
Error: mv failed
```

In this case, use sudo before `curl` and before `bash`:

```bash
sudo curl http://i.sonrd.sh/sonr-io/speedway! | sudo bash
```

### Speedway Daemon

Many commands in Speedway rely on a daemon process for authorization. To start the daemon process, run the following command.

```bash
speedway daemon start
```

You can now log in from any terminal using...

```bash
speedway account login
```

...or create an account...

```bash
speedway account create
```

Subsequent commands will use the existing auth session.

## Building Speedway CLI from source

When you build Speedway CLI from source, you will need to have Go (version [1.17](https://go.dev/dl/#go1.17.13) or [1.18](https://go.dev/dl/#go1.18.6)) installed on your system. To bundle the Speedway UI into Speedway CLI (via the serve command) you will also need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v16.17.0 installed on your system.

Note: _When building from source, you will need to have all the prerequisites installed. You will also need to build the Speedway UI from source to utilize in the Speedway CLI._

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sonr-io/speedway.git
```

CD into the project directory

```bash
cd speedway
```

First Install the Node dependencies (for the Web UI)

```
npm install
```

Then build the Web UI

```bash
npm run build
```

Build the binary (macOS & Linux)

Note: _During the build script you will be prompted to enter your Computer Password to move the binary to /usr/local/bin_

```bash
sudo ./build.sh
```

On some machines, a permissions error occurs:

```bash
mv: rename bin/speedway to /usr/local/bin/speedway: Permission denied
```

In this case, use sudo to move the binary to /usr/local/bin:

```bash
sudo mv bin/speedway /usr/local/bin/speedway && rm -rf bin/
```
